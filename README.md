# magic-mirror-react
This package is inspired on Michel Teeuwens Magic Mirror project. Attempt to create a different flavour of nodejs platform that is is in line with a micro module design from back-end side and a monolithic but modular design from front-end side, based on the very popular framwork React.

To install and run, a standard npm should do the trick:

    npm install && npm start
